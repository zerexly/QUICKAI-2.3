Setup Membership Plans in QuickAI
To manage the membership plans, go to admin -> Membership -> Plans. And here you can manage your membership plans.



Free and trial plans are already available by default. You can edit these plans to change the settings or disable them.

You can specify the OpenAI models for the membership plans. Read more about OpenAI models here -> https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/gpt-3
